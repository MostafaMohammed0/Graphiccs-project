# Graphics Project

This project is a chess game implemented in C++. It demonstrates key programming concepts such as game logic, turn-based mechanics, and rule enforcement. The program is designed to provide a fully functional chess game, complete with all standard rules and piece movements, offering a practical foundation for understanding game development and logic implementation.

## What the Project Does

This project is a chess game built using C++. It allows users to play a traditional chess game, complete with rules, movements, and interactions. The game includes the following features:

- **Game Rules Enforcement**: Ensures valid moves according to chess rules.
- **Piece Movements**: Implements all standard piece movements, including special moves like castling and en passant.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Alternates turns between two players.
- **Graphical Representation**: Displays the chessboard and pieces for easy interaction.
- **Modular Design**: Uses a structured codebase for clarity and extensibility.

## How It Works

The project follows a structured process to simulate a chess game:

1. **Setup**: Initializes the game board, pieces, and player turns.
2. **Move Validation**: Ensures each move complies with chess rules.
3. **Piece Interaction**: Updates the board and manages piece captures.
4. **Check and Checkmate Detection**: Identifies game-ending scenarios like checkmate or stalemate.
5. **Display Updates**: Continuously renders the updated board after each turn.
6. **Endgame Handling**: Declares a winner or a draw when the game concludes.

## Prerequisites

- A modern C++ compiler (C++11 or higher)
- OpenGL or relevant graphics libraries (depending on project requirements)


## Usage
